## Projects

### 🚀 Penetration Testing

*Objective:* Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment

Penetration testing (often called "pen testing") is a cybersecurity process where ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks on a computer system, network, or web application. The goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could potentially use to breach security defenses. By mimicking real-world attacks, pen testing helps organizations find weaknesses in their infrastructure, allowing them to strengthen their security measures before an actual attack occurs. It involves methods such as scanning for weaknesses, exploiting security flaws, and reporting findings for remediation

*Key Features:*
- *Vulnerability Identification:* usage of various tools and techniques to discover potential security weaknesses in a system, such as unpatched software, weak passwords, and misconfigurations.
- *Risk identification:* provides a clear understanding of the risks associated with each vulnerability, helping prioritize the most critical issues.
- *Real-world Scenario Simulation:* imulates actual attack scenarios that might be used by cybercriminals, providing insight into how well defenses can withstand such attacks.

*Technologies Used:*
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite
- Nessus
- Nmap
